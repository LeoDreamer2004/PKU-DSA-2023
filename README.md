# DSA2023
Final Assignment for Data Structure and Algorithm 2023

The game is to explicit same block and get score.
Two teams operate by turns, and the team with higher score wins.

Final code for match is in `code/official.py`, and updated to `code/beautify.py` for report writing.

It's a pity that we lose in the first round, accidentally.
